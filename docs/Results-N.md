## Distinct nitrogen cycle between the seawater and sediment at the slope and bottom
- Most genes involved in nitrate reduction to ammonia are widespread, and can be found in various MAGs. Dissimilatory nitrate reduction with NarGHI and nitrite reduction with NirBD are the most popular pathway in all environments. NarGH co-occur in all environments, but NirBD only occur in and co-occur with NarGHI in water samples.
- Nearly all gene abundance involved in Nitrate reduction has the same trend between sediment and water in bottom-axis and slope. Most genes have a higher relative abundance in sediment except narI and nirBD. Meanwhile, narI do not co-occur with narH or narG in slope water.
- For denitrification, abundance of key genes decreases with substrate charge. In slope water and sediment, gene abundance of norZ is very low compared to bottom-axis, and nosZ only co-occur with amoC in slope water. In the bottom-axis, morZ co-occur with amoABC in Archaea and even co-occur with nirS in the bottom sediment samples.
- Only 2 genes, nifD and nifK, involved in nitrogen fixation show co-occurrence pattern in gene map, and tightly connected with CYP55 in the water samples. Surprisingly, CYP55 encodes enzyme catalyzing nitrogen oxide reduction.
- AmoABC are abundant in all environments except bottom water, and co-occur with a series of Archaea genes including ant, gdhA, nirK, ureC and glnA. However, in the bottom water, norZ also have strong connection with these genomes.

### Nitrogen loss (denitrification)
- Nitrate transport genes nrtABCD are abundant in the bottom water,
    - indicating a high flux of nitrate import of Proteobacteria in the bottom water.
- Genes (narGHI, napAB) catalyzing the first step of both nitrate reduction and denitrification are more abundant in seawater and sediment in the bottom compared to all samples in slope (Fig. 4B, Fig. 5A-B).
- However, the relative abundance of keys genes
    - in the assimilatory or dissimilatory nitrite reduction are distinct between seawater and sediments in the bottom of the CD.
    - For examples, the abundance of ferredoxin-nitrite reductase NirA in the assimilatory process
        - is significant higher in the bottom sediment compared to the bottom seawater,
        - while the situation is reversed for nrfBD of dissimilatory process (Fig. 4B, Fig. 5, Supplemental Fig. S?).
- A co-occurrence pattern is detected between nirBD, nasA and NRT in water samples (Supplemental Fig.S6),
    - while this relationship is absence in sediment samples.
    - It suggests that microbial in bottom water prefer dissimilatory nitrite reduction, while both assimilatory and dissimilatory nitrite reduction.
    - In contrast, the abundance of key genes in denitrification pathway (??) are significantly higher in sediment than water samples,
    - and the abundance of these genes is also higher in the bottom than the slope (Fig. ?, Supplemental...).
    - The co-occurrence relationship between nirS and nosZ is only obtained in bottom sediment, while nirK, norZ and amo gens are tightly connected to each other in the co-occurrence network.
    - Nitrite reductase (NO-forming, nirK) is the most abundant gene involved in nitrogen loss in the slope.
        - Another NO-forming gene CYP55 is only found in water samples and more abundant in the slope water. This gene is annotated from a Caulobacteraceae and co-occur with a nifD involved in Nitrogen fixation
    - In general, denitrification has been detected in both slope and bottom area, while the last step may only occur in the bottom.
        - The flux of Nitrogen production may be higher in the bottom sediment compared to bottom water.

### Nitrogen recycling (nitrogen fixation, ammonia oxidation)
- ureC degradate urea and generate ammonia. This are abundant in all environments.
    - In bottom water samples, most ureC genes are annotated as Actinomycetia and Gammaproteobacteria.
    - However, in other environments, ureC annotated from Nitrososphaeria are the most abundant.
- Genes involved in nitrogen fixation also obtained a different abundance between sediment and water samples.
    - nifDK are mostly found in slope water, while nifH are mostly found in sediment. nifD and nifH have similar abundance in slope sediment, indicating that nitrogen fixation is likely to happen in the slope.
- Ammonia oxidate genes are found to be co-occured in Archaea MAGs, and they are abundant in slope sediment as well as all slope samples.
    - These Archaea also encode genes such as nosZ, amt, UreC, glnA
        - indicating the importance of ammonia import for ammonia oxidation Archaea.
- hao-like gene are annotated for the potential to oxidate hydroxylamine to nitrite.
    - The hydroxylamine dehydrogenase are abundant in the sediment samples in both bottom and axis, and co-occur with nirD in Bacteria such as Marinisomatia and Phycisphaerae.
    - However, another hydroxylamine oxidate gene hox have not been found in our study.

### Ammonia update and organic/inorganic nitrogen Nitrogen transform
- Ammonia transporter amt can be found in out MAGs of both Archaea and Bacteria,
    - and always co-occur with a group of genes such as nirK, gdhA, and glnA.
- Meanwhile, CPS1 (NH3 to Arg) and nos (Arg to nitrogen oxidate) are found in MAGs.
    - CPS1 is only found in a Nitrospiria from water samples, while nos is more abundant in the sediment.
    - A nos annotated from an Alphaproteobacteria annotated from bottom and sediment samples are also found in the slope water, and obtained a relative high abundance. This indicates an undetected MAG in the slope water or an mixture between sediment and water samples in the slope.
